# Customer Mall Segmentation and Clustering using Python

The purpose of this project was to identify the most important customer groups for a marketing team to target using data analysis and machine learning approaches. The project's data comprised of information about mall clients, such as their age, gender, annual income, and spending score. <br />

The data was imported into a Pandas DataFrame to begin the analysis, and several visualizations were created to explore the correlations between the variables. Univariate plots were used to depict the distribution of each individual variable, and bivariate plots were used to visualize the interactions between pairs of variables. The data was also summarized using statistical measures such as the mean and standard deviation. <br />

The data was then clustered to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics. Customers were divided into clusters using the KMeans algorithm based on their annual income and expenditure score. The best number of clusters was established by locating the "elbow" in a plot of the inertia_ values for various n clusters values. <br />

Finally, the clustering findings were visualized and analyzed in order to better understand the characteristics of the various clusters and to determine the most important consumer groups for the marketing team to target. <br />
