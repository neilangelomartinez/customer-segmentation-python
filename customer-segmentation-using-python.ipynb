Univariate plots were used to depict the distribution of each individual variable, and bivariate plots were used to visualize the interactions between pairs of variables. The data was also summarized using statistical measures such as the mean and standard deviation.\n\nThe data was then clustered to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics. Customers were divided into clusters using the KMeans algorithm based on their annual income and expenditure score. The best number of clusters was established by locating the \"elbow\" in a plot of the inertia_ values for various n clusters values.\n\nFinally, the clustering findings were visualized and analyzed in order to better understand the characteristics of the various clusters and to determine the most important consumer groups for the marketing team to target.","metadata":{}}]}
